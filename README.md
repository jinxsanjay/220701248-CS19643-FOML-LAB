
# 🌸 Menstrual Cycle Predictor using Machine Learning

An intelligent and user-personalized menstrual cycle prediction app built with **Streamlit**, **XGBoost & Random Forest**, and **SQLite**. It allows users to track their cycles, mood, and cramps, and provides accurate predictions based on user symptoms and cycle patterns.

## 🚀 Features

- 🔐 **Login & Signup System** using SQLite (secure password hashing with SHA-256)
- 🔮 **Cycle Length Prediction** using an XGBoost regression model
- 🩸 **Symptom Tracking** (Mood + Cramps) via Streamlit UI
- 📈 **Trend Visualizations**:
  - Predicted Cycle Length over time
  - Mood and Cramps scores combined in a single chart
- 📅 **Upcoming Period Forecast** – displays next 4 predicted periods
- 🧠 **User-Specific History** – users can view only their past predictions
- 🧹 **Clear History** per user
